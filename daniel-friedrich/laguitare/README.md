# La Guitare - by Daniel Friedrich and Emile Leipp

This repository contains a digital conversion of an original work by Daniel
Friedrich and Emile Leipp, created during their time at the Groupe d'Acoustique
Musicale (GAM) at Universit√© Paris VI. The GAM was a pioneering group in the
study of musical acoustics and, from 1963 to 1987, significantly advanced
research in this field. Their seminars and publications have made substantial
contributions to the understanding of musical instruments, particularly in this
detailed examination of classical guitar construction and acoustics.

### About This Project

As an amateur luthier and long-time admirer of Daniel Friedrich's work, I took
on the task of converting this valuable document into a modern format, suitable
for reading on devices like tablets and Kindles. The purpose of this project is
not only to improve readability but also to support future translations,
enabling this knowledge to reach a broader audience.

The original bulletin can be accessed here:
[Original GAM Bulletin PDF](https://www.lam.jussieu.fr/Publications/BulletinsGAM/GAM_92-La%20Guitare_Friederich.pdf).

If you would like to contribute to translations or collaborate on format
improvements, please feel free to make contributions directly to this
repository.

When releasing the string, let’s take the 6th string, the low E - after creating a 
#tension#, #thus a simultaneous movement# of the table and the neck, through 
finger pressure on the string, a complex vibration of the instrument can be observed.

1°) #Direct Way#

The table begins to oscillate and vibrate due to the string’s action.

The neck also moves, particularly the head (easily verified by holding it 
between your fingers) at the other end of the string.

If the neck’s wood and heel are hard and rigid enough, and the back is 
flexible and lightly braced, a movement will occur where the back stretches 
alternately under the tension from the heel (<<fig-25,Figure 25>>). This 
movement cannot exist without a domed and arched back.

The part of the table (which is arched) behind the bridge also experiences 
additional tension with each vibration of the string (which merges into a 
complex vibratory mode).

These vibrations are immediately transmitted to the sides and back by the 
material used, reinforcing certain frequencies and giving a particular 
character to an entire range of sounds.

2°) #Indirect Way#, through the air

The vibrating air volume created by the table’s movements will activate the 
back and sides around their own frequencies and project sound waves through 
the table's opening.

All these vibrations combine and overlap to create complex sounds with a 
certain character, which the luthier attempts to control.

#The Neck#

Upon closer observation of the neck, three possible flexion points or joints 
are seen, which are the site of vibratory movements upon releasing the string 
and combine instantly (<<fig-26,Figure 26>>).

#Let’s take two extreme cases#:

This neck can be made of hard, heavy, and rigid wood,

- or carved from a soft, light wood,
- or simply too thin or too thick.

_(A neck is considered too thin when, under string tension, its deflection 
exceeds 4/10 mm. If this tolerance is exceeded, buzzing of the bass strings 
and "snapping" of the trebles will occur as early as the sixth or seventh fret, 
forcing the bridge saddle to be raised.)_

#Heavy and rigid neck#:

In the case of a too heavy and rigid neck, we can imagine that upon 
releasing the string, its reaction - suddenly freed – #will hinder the 
string's movement#. It #dominates# the system and will prevent the rapid 
establishment of low-frequency vibrations, for example. The bass notes will 
be dry and lack warmth. It behaves like a filter.

This neck, pulling erratically, will also hinder the table, resulting in 
difficult coupling, non-spontaneous sound emission, and ultimately a loss of 
power.

#Flexible, light, or thin neck#:

On the opposite end, a very flexible or too thin neck is also problematic. 
When the finger presses on the string to create tension, it is the weakest, 
most flexible end that bends and moves. In this case, it will be the neck 
that moves forward, not the table, which is not the desired result in 
lutherie.

It is tempting to conclude that in any case, the important thing is to move 
the table, ensuring that the string action only manifests on the table side. 
Some luthiers place a very robust neck on their guitars or create an internal 
reinforcement for this neck. The solution to this type of problem often lies 
in a compromise between advantages and disadvantages.

#The Table#

The problem becomes more complicated with the table, located at the other 
end of the string.

It, too, can be schematically designed in two different extreme ways.

1. #Too rigid a table#. It moves little, resulting in a small, rather dry 
   and clear sound with little amplitude and difficult playability.
2. #Too flexible a table#. Large amplitudes favor bass frequencies, with a 
   very strong second harmonic, easy playability, and warmth in the bass, 
   but generally a short sound.

It is possible to visualize and illustrate this oscillating system at little 
cost by placing on two small rollers spaced forty centimeters apart, a first 
spruce strip 5 millimeters by 5 millimeters in cross-section (<<fig-27,Figure 
27>>). By hanging a 500 g weight in the middle, gently pulling it down and 
releasing it, a fairly rapid and long-lasting movement is observed (the weight 
represents the action of the strings on the table).

Then by placing a strip of the same wood but thinner, only 3 millimeters 
thick, if the operation is repeated, a large amplitude movement is observed, 
much slower and shorter, representing the behavior of an overly flexible table.

#Table and Neck#

When combining the Table and Neck, two extreme cases emerge:

1. #Too rigid Table and Neck#: Only the string stretches, nothing moves 
   easily, sound emission is difficult, the sound is small, dry, poorly 
   toned, metallic, and lacks bass.
2. #Too flexible Table and Neck#: There will be a lot of bass, the guitar 
   will feel soft to play (with a mushy phrasing). The sound will be short in 
   general, dull, and there will be buzzing and snapping when attacking the 
   notes.

We may also consider adding a flexible neck to a rigid table or vice versa, 
as we have already seen. As always in lutherie, this will be an artistic 
choice, representing the creator’s personality.

The quest for power, that is, #balancing the "Table-Neck-String" system#, 
can be facilitated by the #Measurement of Neck and Table Flexibility 
separately#, and then by the same measurement, once the instrument is 
#finished#, with the strings tightened and loosened, as we will see in the 
section "Flexion Controls."

#Remark#:

In the past, luthiers would tighten the strings of their instruments until 
they "rang" and worked well. Today, demands seem to be higher. Indeed, to 
achieve a long, well-toned sound, without weaknesses across three and a half 
octaves, considerable research is necessary, while maintaining a fixed tuning 
set by the A 440 Hz tuning fork.

To create the optimal tuning and the right balance of the table, neck, and 
strings, a neck with an adjustable attachment and two screws that brace the 
table can be made. We built one ourselves, but the variation is not large 
enough.

#Second solution#: The only option left is to adjust the table after testing 
the instrument (this correction is only possible with a bracing system designed 
for this purpose).

#Third solution#: It is possible to improve things by changing the string 
tension.

A final observation regarding the wood used for over a century in the necks 
of most quality classical guitars: Honduras Cedar seems to have a rare 
quality in addition to its stability and lightness. Its highly dampened 
texture (and very fragile to knocks) allows it to stop and filter certain 
vibrations from the head, which could be harmful if they reverberated into 
the soundbox, blending with the vibrations from the bridge side. This wood 
therefore gives the sound cleanliness, clarity, and homogeneity, along with 
spontaneity due to its lightness.

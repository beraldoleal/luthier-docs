== Examination of a Piece of Softwood

=== Structure of Spruce

These woods are primarily composed of #axial cells# (along the length) which
are tiny "juxtaposed tubes" ranging from one and a half millimeters to four
and a half millimeters in length. They often make up about 90% of the total
volume of the wood.

Radial cells (from the center outwards) are also present, forming the wood
Rays.

Axial cells (tracheids) are of two types (<<fig-29,Figure 29>>):

1. Those that form at the beginning of the growth season (in the initial zone)
   with thin walls, which are sap-conducting elements.
2. Those that form at the end of the growth season in the final zone, with
   #thick walls# and a flattened section, which serve as #support# elements,
   providing wood rigidity and strength.

These tightly packed cells define the annual layers and #form the grain#.

External factors (the meristem) significantly influence the structure and
determine the proportion of spring cells and late autumn wood cells. These
factors include altitude, the immediate environment of the tree, the soil,
and rainfall.

It is known that altitude (around 1,000 m) often results in spruce with thin
layers, as the growing season is shorter. This generally produces a heavy
and dense wood, known as #strong texture# wood.

The autumn latewood cells are thus the natural #framework# of spruce in the
#longitudinal# direction.

It is rare to find trees that have grown consistently over the two or three
centuries needed to yield fine luthier wood. The annual layers are irregular
due to factors like higher rainfall or warmer temperatures in certain years.
Felling a neighboring tree immediately causes an enlargement of the cell
layers. This is evident in cross-sections where denser and stiffer areas can
be observed in certain spots.

In the radial direction of the tree, a multitude of wood rays, with
lenticular or very flattened sections, form the "fabric" of the transverse
wood, its "solid" framework (<<fig-28,Figure 28>>). The height of the wood
rays is slight, between one and three tenths of a millimeter. They are
composed of cells with walls of varying thickness. The rays, according to
their number and thickness, seem to condition the radial stiffness, that is,
"across the grain".footnote:[On this matter, the Technical Center for Wood,
when consulted, replied that this hypothesis "was highly probable".].

An important observation arises here: if a board is taken #off the perfect
axis of the spruce trunk#, the wood rays are no longer whole, but
#fragmented#, resulting in a "softness" across the grain. This causes a
significant difference between a board cut from the axis and another taken
from a different part of the tree.

A deduction also follows: when purchasing wood, the presence of fine
#shimmering flecks# under the light indicates the presence of wood rays cut
with the surrounding "fibers". This suggests that the board was taken from
the tree's center and will exhibit maximum transverse stiffness.

A known source of irregularity in the mechanical properties of woods,
especially spruce, is that wood grain often does not grow perfectly parallel
and vertical. Within the thickness of the board, one can observe undulations
in the direction of the fibers. In this case, the grain is called "twisted,"
leading to highly varied mechanical properties between different pieces.

For all the reasons previously outlined, when cutting pieces for instrument
bracing (from a single board), one may find that pieces from a particularly
hard and resinous section show flexion and mechanical characteristics that
vary widely, sometimes being three times stronger than a piece from a softer
section.

This lack of homogeneity poses a challenge that can be addressed by
inspecting, measuring, and sometimes weighing almost every piece. This allows
for selecting #those with the desired qualities#.

For the soundboards, these checks will focus on:

 - the flexion of the pieces,
 - their weight,
 - their compressibility across the grain.

Compressibility can be measured with a sample several centimeters wide across
the whole width of the just-jointed soundboard, although this measurement is
always challenging.

A soundboard wood that is #highly compressible# is soft across the grain and
flexible, which will yield soft responses and potential rapid fatigue under
the tension of the strings. A precise measurement of this is valuable.

==== Device for Compression Measurement

This involves placing the sample vertically, allowing it to slide, with a
length of around forty centimeters, across the grain, in a case whose walls
hold it straight (similar to a baker's tray pushed after use).

A load of approximately 10 kg per square centimeter of section is then
applied to the end. Compression is read on a dial indicator, which should be
incorporated into the measurement device. The soundboards #will also undergo
a percussion test# at the center of gravity, possibly followed by an analysis
of this impact in the lab (further explored in bulletin no. 93).

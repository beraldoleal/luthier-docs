== Concepts of Flexionfootnote:[See the Technical Center for Wood: Calculation of
Shelves and Racking (1968)]: and Various Checks

A small board loaded at its center is subjected to compressive stress on the
upper part and tensile stress on the lower part, with maximum impact on the
surface fibers.

A neutral fiber is observed in the middle.

- The deformation and curvature of the pieces can be calculated.
- The concept of the Modulus of Elasticity, or Young's modulus, also arises.
  This simply represents the wood's degree of rigidity, which determines
  the extent of flexion.

In guitar making, there are many possible flexions to record that can be
measured using a few simple devices crafted by the experimenter.

[upperroman]
. *Longitudinal Flexion*: By taking one of the two boards that will form
  the soundboard, uniformly planed to 3 mm, for example, it can be placed in
  the device (<<fig-30,Figure 30>>) so that the point of the axis of bending
  aligns precisely with the bridge axis. By applying a weight of about 500 g
  in a suitable location, one can measure the difference using two metal
  rulers (one on each side) sliding on a magnet, or with a dial indicator
  mounted on a support.

+
This is known as #Longitudinal Flexion#.

. *Combined Flexion*: When the soundboard is jointed and glued, a more
  comprehensive measurement can be taken to provide a real indication of its
  flexibility or rigidity with a device (<<fig-31,Figure 31>>) consisting of
  two "outer molds" made of thick, non-deformable wood, with an interior
  outline matching the guitar’s exact shape.

+
By placing these two "molds" together and clamping them tightly (with the
  soundboard in the middle) using presses, it is possible, by applying a
  weight of about eight kilos at the bridge position, to measure the flexion
  with a depth gauge equipped with a rod and dial. This gauge will rest on a
  bridge between the two crossbars, onto which the 8 kg weight, resting on
  the bridge, will be placed at the exact point it will occupy when the
  instrument is complete.

+
This flexion gives the resulting combined stiffness, both transverse and
  longitudinal, hence the name #combined flexion#.

. *Bar Flexion*: After the soundboard wood, it's time to measure the various
  bracing pieces (<<fig-32,Figure 32>>).

+
The flexion of each bar (or brace) can be quickly measured by placing it on
  two small rollers about forty centimeters apart. By hanging a weight of
  five hundred grams, the maximum deformation can be read on a "custom ruler."

. *Bridge Flexion*: This is a notable flexion, as the bridge is a transverse
  brace. One can test a batch of these pieces by randomly measuring a few or
  systematically measuring each one by securing one of the feet in a small
  adapted vice and hanging a weight of 1,000 grams from the other foot. The
  displacement can be easily read with a dial indicator to a tenth of a
  millimeter.

+
For the bridges, one can also measure their susceptibility to warping, an
  important characteristic when seeking to provide independence between the
  bass and treble sides of the guitar. A bridge that is too thick or made of
  very hard wood moves as a single unit, #without flexibility#.

. *Rough Neck Flexion*: (<<fig-33,Figure 33>>) This essential measurement is
  taken when a batch of necks is only roughly cut, meaning shaped with the
  head and heel attached. By securing the neck by the heel tab and applying
  a weight of 10 kg to the headstock, the flexion can be measured with an
  appropriate caliper.

+
It is also necessary to record the #weight# of the raw neck and establish a
  reference system with all the types of wood used for this purpose.

. *Ebony Fingerboard Flexion*: The method is similar to the one described
  for soundboards (longitudinal flexion). By securing one end of the
  fingerboard and placing a weight of 1,000 g at a marked spot, the
  deformation can be read on a metal ruler or with a dial indicator. All
  pieces should be planed to the same thickness beforehand.

. *Dimensional Stability*: In humid tropical climates or coastal areas,
  certain guitars seem to "soften" in performance. Some soundboard woods may
  be particularly hygroscopic. It is well known that certain dense and
  resinous spruce woods resist the impregnation of preservation products by
  soaking, and their saturation point is well below the 28 percent average
  moisture content for this wood.

+
To gain an accurate understanding, samples should be measured before and
  after being alternately immersed in water for ten minutes, or until fully
  saturated if necessary. The experimenter may observe variations ranging
  from minimal to triple, and will prefer wood that is less susceptible
  when constructing for Japan or Brazil.

+
The system is simple: a sliding stop (like a stadiometer) is applied to the
  sample. A magnet-backed dial indicator is placed behind this stop.

. *Neck Flexion* with strings slackened and strings tightened (<<fig-34,Figure 34>>).
  Once the instrument is complete and before varnishing, the neck's behavior
  on the soundbox can be checked by placing the guitar in a device where it
  rests on three points located at the headstock’s end and on either side of
  the widest part of the body (the headstock point should be movable to
  avoid skewing the measurement). It is then easy to place a 10 kg weight
  between the 12th and 19th frets and measure the displacement with a
  caliper between the 11th and 12th frets.

+
Once the guitar is fully finished, the process can be repeated with the
  strings tightened, revealing that some instruments flex more when the
  strings are tightened, raising questions as to why.

. *Soundboard Flexion* with slackened and tightened strings. Without moving
  the guitar, the previous measurement can be followed by testing the
  flexibility of the soundboard once the guitar is finished. The 8 kg weight
  inserted between the bridge crossbars will press on the bridge, which is
  temporarily placed before varnishing.

+
The process is repeated with the glued bridge, then with the strings
  tightened. The luthier can observe greater movement of the soundboard on
  some instruments when the strings are tightened. Generally, the guitar's
  playability improves if the soundboard flexion exceeds 2 millimeters and
  if the neck flexion reaches the same measurement in the previous flexion
  (number IX in this section).

+
A skilled luthier will gain much insight from these various measurements,
  weighing the raw cut soundboards, then the completed soundboards, necks,
  backs, fingerboards, and sides to achieve an instrument with a weight that
  aligns with their expectations and predictions.

+
Heavier instruments produce less string attack and finger noise, though
  there is a limit beyond which the sensitivity, spontaneity, and #sound
  flexibility# are compromised (the margin is narrow).

+
At the end of the twentieth century, it seems worthwhile to spend two to
  three hours on measurements and checks (followed by recording and
  archiving) out of the hundred hours of work required to make a quality
  guitar.

+
For the Art luthier, this precise approach and understanding of mechanical
  elements will lead to greater flexibility and variety in their
  construction, providing an advantage over "industrial guitar makers" who
  are hindered by changes and adjustments.

+
It is not unreasonable to think that the great masters of the past had
  already developed personal reference systems that allowed them, secretly,
  to achieve more with a surer foundation. (We personally hope that these
  control methods constitute the most interesting technical contribution we
  can offer in this essay).

+
A final note in bold letters:

+
**It is impossible to make two identical instruments without using the same wood.**

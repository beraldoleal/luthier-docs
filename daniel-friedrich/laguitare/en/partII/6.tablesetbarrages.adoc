== Soundboards and Bracing

During the 17th and 18th centuries, guitars had soundboards simply reinforced
with a bar placed on each side of the rosette (<<fig-35-38,Figure 35>>).
Occasionally, following the lute’s example, a light bar was added between the
rosette and the bridge.

Towards the end of the 18th century, some experiments appeared in France.
Marchai placed a slanted bar between the rosette and the bridge (<<fig-35-38,Figure 36>>),
but the crucial discovery for the modern guitar seems to have been made in
Andalusia, in Cadiz: Bénédit in 1788 and Pages in 1792 already employed a
structure with five wooden ribs (<<fig-35-38,Figure 37>>).

They discovered a revolutionary bracing system that would further differentiate
the guitar’s sound from that of the lute, giving it the distinctive character
we recognize today.

Antonio de Torres (1817 - 1892) must have known the renowned guitars of Pages
in his time, and he enhanced the system by adding two ribs (<<fig-35-38,Figure 38>>),
expanding the width of his guitars to 35 or 36 cm around 1860.

A bit of research reveals that this bracing provides rigidity, longitudinal
strength, and greater transverse flexibility #with less thickness#. By gluing
three ribs onto a forty-centimeter-long, 2.6 mm thick piece of softwood
(<<fig-39,Figure 39>>), one can observe that a board thickness of 5.2 mm would be
required to achieve the same flexion, resistance, and go from 46 grams to
73 grams footnote:[The same result is observed if the ribs are integrated into
the board itself (not glued)].

This considerable weight reduction for the soundboard allows:

- more spontaneity in response,
- greater sensitivity,
- increased maximum range (more bass),
- and longer sustain, as there is less internal friction in a thinner wood.

Following Antonio de Torres's method, guitars gained strong basses, sparking
a lasting preference for this type of instrument for over a century. In recent
years, however, there’s been a slight shift in the opposite direction.
(Remember that the guitar has grown in bass range since the late 16th century.)

All luthiers know how to make instruments with generous bass… The challenge
lies in achieving quality bass, mid, and treble on the same guitar.

=== Roles of a Well-Designed Soundboard Bracing

1. Allows the setup of multiple vibrational modes, amplifying many of the
   frequencies in the string's rich signal. Dividing the vibrating surface
   into sectors or parcels with a bracing network enables the creation of
   complex vibrational modes, unlike a simple wooden soundboard
   footnote:[See Savart’s thesis in the recently republished Roret
   Encyclopedia collection. (Title: The Luthier). The author discusses
   experiments on vibrating plates. (see bibliography)].
2. Produces a beautiful, distinctive, and interesting sound.
3. The bracing must remain mechanically stable for a long time, under the
   intense tension from the strings.
4. #Should not be too rigid#. This would make the play feel too firm, with
   a dry sound lacking flexibility, warmth, and bass.
5. #Should not be too flexible# footnote:[The soundboard flexion can be
   measured—see chapter #Flexion#.] as this would produce a strong but short
   sound, low and dull, with easy playability but strings that "snap" under
   the fingers and sluggish response in rapid passages. The instrument would
   saturate quickly with strong playing.
6. The bracing should not cause erratic reactions within the "Neck-Soundboard-Strings"
   system.
7. Ideally, the bracing should allow for adjustments, modifications, or fine-tuning
   after testing.
8. The bracing network can help prevent shrinkage cracks—a useful feature
   for reinforcing the soundboard, which is subject to tension from drying or
   relaxation from humidity.

The importance of the soundboard bracing network takes time to establish. It is
crafted based on the woods used and the intended result. The best outcomes often
lie near the wood's strength limit, making the system's longevity precarious.

Modern guitars have little durability reserve on the bracing side and are not
designed to maintain the same sound for a century.

But it’s not just the bracing that determines sound quality. #The nature of
the wood itself on the soundboard#, the vibrating plate, is very #important# and
initially imparts a tone color, a specific quality, or unique character.

Each piece of wood within a species has unique properties to be discovered.
One may produce a warm, rich sound with strong character but somewhat dark, making
chords opaque when multiple tones overlap.

On the other hand, another tree might offer longer sustain, clarity, and a
bright attack, making a guitar better suited for playing Bach rather than Turina
or Villa-Lobos.

Since there is no "one-size-fits-all" guitar (you can’t simultaneously have
the qualities of a “brunette” and a “blonde”), the luthier must accept a
compromise or sell multiple guitars to their affluent clients, as is often the
case for well-known guitarists.

With adjustments to the bracing, these distinct characteristics can be balanced
and adjusted, showcasing mastery for those with the ambition.

In any case, note that string vibrations diminish for at least three reasons:

a) Air resistance against the soundboard's movements.

b) Internal friction within the soundboard as it moves (converting
   transferred energy into heat).

c) Internal friction within the string.

=== Woods Used

Two types of softwoods are mainly favored by luthiers:

1. European Spruce (Picea Excelsa), growing at around one thousand meters
   altitude, provides a solid texture wood.
2. Canadian Western Red Cedar (Thuja Plicata), which grows in British
   Columbia near the Pacific Ocean, offers a softer wood that is more fragile
   to impact (less resilient) but is always more flexible and elastic along
   the grain than spruce. Additionally, it is a less dampened wood.

These two types of softwood, which vary widely from tree to tree, can be:

1. #Dampened or undampened# (This means that when a wooden panel labeled
   "dampened" is lightly struck, the sound is #dull# and fades quickly,
   absorbed by the material. When the wood is sonorous, "undampened," the
   impact sound is clear and sustained).
2. Heavy or light.
3. Fibrous or with straight grain.
4. Strong (like steel) or weak (like copper) in texture.
5. The grain may be straight, parallel, or slanted.
6. The wood can be elastic or rigid.

Let’s examine the expected results of #dampened, flexible, and light#
softwood.

Without correction from the bracing, achieving a clear, responsive, and long
sound guitar would be challenging. The sound would be rather round, dark,
with short sustain, making it easy to play but quick to saturate.

A heavy and very hard soundboard wood would tend to produce a hard, dry,
metallic sound with weak bass harmonics, lacking warmth and with a stiff
response.

The "ideal" wood would fall between these two extremes for most luthiers.

It’s also noted that certain conifers have well-bound, very solid fibers
(like steel).

After ten years of use, there’s little deformation, and the sound remains
well-defined and vigorous.

In other woods of the same species, the material loosens over time, and the
instrument becomes less or unevenly resonant. The central part of the
soundboard may become completely inactive, stressed, and "worn out."

A rough estimate of wood’s resistance to deformation can be made by keeping
a sample board slightly bent in the middle, with its two ends resting on a
small block.

After a year, the setup can be loosened to see if the board straightens
again or not (<<fig-40,Figure 40>>). Alternatively, one could make a single guitar
with this wood and observe it over a year.

Wood fibers aligned parallel to the thickness of the soundboard contribute to
durability over time. When the grain is slanted, the board is less resistant
along its length, and significant deformations occur without correction from
bracing or additional thickness.

The challenge for a builder who aspires to create is to control all the data
presented here and gradually integrate it into their knowledge.

The artistic conception of an instrument is the most delicate part, requiring
skill and involving many contradictions. It is a continuous choice that can
cause much anxiety.

With each choice, the instrument improves as one becomes more familiar with
the available woods… but the obstacles are numerous.

Here is an #irritating contradiction#.

For soundboards, if you want a sound with strong personality, character, and
richness, you need a relatively hard and rigid wood in both directions, which
theoretically produces sharp resonance peaks.

However, it will be a contrasting wood, #dampened#, that offers a homogeneous
response with equal sound level.

As a full book would be required to discuss the problems of bracing and
soundboards, let’s conclude this chapter with a golden rule:

[quote]
A complex, rich, personal sound with character cannot be achieved without a
complex and unique bracing on a carefully selected soundboard.

This is one of the secrets.

== The Bridge

The bridge transmits string vibrations to the soundboard. It is the last part glued
during construction. For over a century, its shape and structure have been refined
for guitars intended for fingerstyle playing.

The old bridge of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries resembled that of the lute—a
simple piece of wood, a small glued bar to which the strings were attached. It should
have been called the "tailpiece," as the strings no longer crossed over it as in the
13th century.

The current bridge design emerged after numerous experiments across Europe.
Some sketches will illustrate the main stages of its evolution (<<fig-41,Figure 41>>).

The French luthier La Prévotte seems to be a notable contributor to this collective
creation. Before 1856, he used a bridge with modern characteristics, namely, two
distinct parts in its structure (<<fig-42,Figure 42>>):

- Part A: the new component, which can be called the "bridge" with its saddle.
- Part B: which can be called the "tailpiece" for convenience, is the simple
  bar common to both lutes and guitars. Part A precisely defines the vibrating
  length of the string, and the height of its saddle, placed below the string
  to lift it, applies pressure and torsion on the soundboard through the
  combination of parts A and B.

Combining these two parts on a single base reveals their functional reality.

An immediate observation emerges: the more the angle C.D.E. (<<fig-43,Figure 43>>)
is closed, the greater the torsion effect, and the stronger the string's pressure
at D. This results in basses with deep, resonant amplitude if the soundboard is
not too rigid. This was one of the appeals of guitars in the 1850s, which were
larger-bodied and introduced genuinely deep, rich bass tones.

The luthier can alter this angle if they decide to work with a "thicker" soundboard
and force it to operate under greater tension.

Today’s bridge is made of rosewood and weighs about 18 grams. Being an additional
cross-brace in the center of the soundboard, making it too rigid or heavy, such as
in ebony, results in poor sound quality. The combined inertia and rigidity reduce
independence between the instrument's bass and treble sides, cancel certain possible
vibrational modes in the soundboard, and cut off a series of frequencies, reducing
the instrument’s timbre and sound level consistency.

To objectively observe the exact effect of a bridge type, one must use a device
described in (<<fig-44,Figure 44>>). With a 10 kg pull applied to the string using a
weight, one can record the deformation of the board in front of and behind the bridge.

The current classical bridge causes greater deformation on the back of the soundboard
than on the front. In reality, this effect can be even more pronounced if a transverse
brace is glued beneath the soundboard near the front of the bridge. In this case, the
back of the soundboard undergoes larger movements and works more than the front,
since the bridge rests on the more rigid front part of the soundboard, allowing it to
oscillate and pivot slightly.

When the guitar is finished, this can be verified with two dial indicators placed
on each side of the bridge. When the strings are tightened, one can observe which
part is more active, offering insights into functionality (differences can vary
from simple to double, or even more).

Using the same setup in <<fig-44,Figure 44>>, it’s possible to measure and plot the
deformation that a narrower bridge (17 mm) produces, with the same angle CDE and
total saddle height (essentially the current bridge without its tailpiece). If the
torsion effect is stronger locally, the overall deformation is approximately the
same, or very slightly greater, as the effort required with a smaller lever is
greater to produce a deformation similar to that of a standard 30 mm bridge. This
balances things out. footnote:[Other views on bridge issues can be found in Charles
Besnainou's Bulletin No. 72 on the lute.]

The only drawback is that this narrow bridge risks coming unglued when used.

On the other hand, its lightness could be advantageous for instrument responsiveness
and high frequencies conveyed by the string.

The current bridge design has certainly not reached its final form. Asymmetric
bridges can be made with a stronger hold on the bass side of the soundboard—wider
and heavier on the bass side to yield solid low tones, while a narrower, thinner
treble side could enhance treble response.

Convincing guitarists to accept this modification is another challenge.

In the United States, Kasha even recommends using separate bridges for bass and
treble and builds his guitars this way. One might suspect, with caution, that in
this case sympathetic resonances are reduced, and homogeneity in the midrange
difficult to achieve.

The evolution continues...

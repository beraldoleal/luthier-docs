== The Back - The Sides

=== General Considerations

The overall weight of the instrument can influence its sound. When a guitar is
heavy, the initial noise from the string attack (caused by finger friction) is less
noticeable than on a very light guitar. The sound emerges differently, with a dull,
muted attack, resulting in a more crystalline tone. This allows for more precise
phrasing during fast passages.

A heavier instrument generally has a longer sustain and responds better in higher
registers, producing a brighter overall tone.

To achieve this, modern luthiers have used heavier woods or increased the thickness
of the instrument’s components.

While Jean Voboam in 1706 already used an exotic wood like "violet wood" that was
dense and fine, it appears this choice was decorative. By the late eighteenth
century, however, when Pages in Andalusia used rosewood for his backs, he may have
been observing its effect on sound.

Gradually, this wood was recognized for yielding the best results, and every
attempt to substitute another wood was invariably abandoned. Antonio de Torres
often tried maple in the last century, Francisco Simplicio preferred Cuban mahogany
in the first third of this century, Ignacio Fleta more recently crafted a guitar
in flamed maple around 1958; and I have personally experimented with Amaranth,
Ceylon Lemonwood, Cypress, and Cuban Mahogany.

Whether it’s rosewood from India, Madagascar, or Brazil, this wood gives the guitar
a noble voice, well-rounded, full-bodied, and endows it with its quality and
character as a classical guitar.

These guitars are currently much heavier than those made fifteen years ago, weighing
between 1650 grams to 1850 grams. Guitarists, accustomed to the lightweight designs
of Antonio de Torres, Manuel Ramirez, and Francisco Simplicio, initially struggled
to appreciate the qualities of a heavier instrument.

This style was initially rejected, with proponents of the "old guitar" arguing that
one couldn’t have a career without it. This mindset has since vanished, and it is now
rare to find concert guitarists performing on guitars over ten years old.

In construction, two extreme approaches are worth noting:

1. Making thin sides and a thin, lightly-braced back, yielding deep basses, warmth,
   strong bass response, a noticeable attack, and a potentially short, muted tone.
2. Or making a thicker back (above three hundred grams), more heavily braced, with
   thick, heavy sides, producing more brilliance, a metallic timbre, and longer
   sustain with moderate bass response.

=== The Sides

The sides play an important role, as their vibrating surface area is roughly equal
to that of the back. Additionally, their height determines the resonator cavity
volume of the guitar body, providing the instrument’s "body" or resonance. The natural
frequency of the sides is high due to their curvature.

Antonio de Torres's experiment, which involved constructing a guitar with cardboard
sides (the guitar is preserved at the Conservatory of Barcelona Museum), may not have
been fully interpreted by its creator, who reportedly stated that "only the soundboard
played a significant role, and the sides didn’t matter since they could be made of
cardboard." It’s possible to say that this instrument sounded like a guitar with
#cardboard sides# of varying rigidity, thereby influencing part of its response.

=== The Back

The back can serve three main functions:

1. With its bracing, it firmly supports the neck heel, preventing it from tipping
   under the tension of the strings (40 to 50 kilograms).
2. Braced with three or four wooden bars across, the back is also a multi-resonator,
   resonant across numerous frequencies.
3. The back acts as a sound reflector within the acoustic chamber formed by the
   guitar body.

It should be noted that the thicker the back, the higher its natural frequencies and
vibrational modes, favoring higher tones.

The more numerous and higher the bracing bars that divide it into sectors, the more
high frequencies can find resonance within it.

=== Resonator

This can be verified with a hollow glass tube about 25 centimeters long and 5 to 7 mm
in diameter, which acts as a frequency generator. Simply place one end of the tube
(with a small wooden peg) on the guitar’s back and hold the upper end between the thumb
and two fingers like a pencil. Moisten the fingers with vinegar water, then quickly slide
them along the tube, varying pressure to produce a "vibrating plate" effect on a specific
section of the back, emitting a distinct tone unique to that section.

By moving the contact point on the back, various frequencies emerge. If the experiment is
performed on a guitar with strings, each sound, each frequency produced by the tube
induces sympathetic resonances and high harmonics from the strings. This suggests that if
one vibrates a string with a finger, the signal with its harmonics will find amplification
and resonance in the various back sections, confirming its secondary role as a versatile
resonator.

Vibrations can be measured at a specific point on the back when a string is played open.
A hundredth-millimeter dial gauge reveals variations that can be substantial: 2 to 3
hundredths of a millimeter for the low E and 4 to 5 hundredths for the D, indicating the
back’s preference for certain frequencies.

=== Reflector

The back also acts as a reflector, or a "rebounder" as some builders say. The internal
soundwave produced by the soundboard upon string release (a series of compressions)
encounters a surface that’s variably rigid, polished, or varnished on the inside of the
back. These planar waves exit, slightly dampened or not, through the rosette, which acts
like a speaker centered on the soundboard, contributing to the overall sound produced by
the entire vibrating surface of the instrument.
footnote:[These waves emitted by the rosette can be visualized by placing a light sheet of
paper over the soundboard, almost completely blocking the opening. When plucking a low
string, the paper vibrates.]

In the early twentieth century, some luthiers even conceived of placing an "acoustic cone"
flaring inward, attached around the rosette beneath the soundboard. This device was
intended to "capture" all waves reflecting off the back and direct them more easily
toward the exit.

This system was abandoned, suggesting that the experiment was inconclusive.

=== Remark

Note: The guitar vibrates across all its parts but is primarily directional. An observer
directly facing the instrument hears a louder sound than one to the side. As noted, the
back and its first brace support the neck heel. This part of the back vibrates more
intensely under the leverage exerted by the neck, oscillating with the string frequency
(in a simplified model). This can be easily tested by placing a hand over this area
immediately after plucking a string; one can observe the disappearance of certain
harmonics, which return when the hand is lifted. This is especially true if the back is
flexible, lightly braced, and at the low string frequency.

Such observations led Aguado in the last century to design a "Tripod" that allowed the
guitar to remain free and not pressed against the player, enabling it to vibrate freely
(see cover).

The neck with its heel also directly influences the back when it’s lightly braced and
flexible; the back alternates tension and relaxation under the influence of the vibrating
string. Each oscillation of the string corresponds to increased tension at the ends,
causing the back to stretch and flatten if it’s curved.

For a low E note, around 80 hertz, there would be about 160 of these movements per second,
producing a vibration an octave above the fundamental, creating a strong "second" harmonic,
noticeable on thin-backed guitars.

Theoretically, if the soundboard section in front of the bridge
footnote:[The bridge, depending on the internal bracing pattern of the soundboard, may
activate more either in front or behind its position.] is moved by the same oscillation
and increased tension of the vibrating string, its inward movement into the guitar will
coincide with an opposite movement of the back lowering. Together, these movements create
a train of strong amplitude waves, yielding an even stronger second harmonic, resulting
in rich, deep bass tones.

However, if the soundboard section behind the bridge is more active, its outward movement
may counteract the back's inward movement, potentially canceling out these effects. This
could explain the presence of poorly toned bass on light, thin-structured guitars that
shouldn’t exhibit such a deficiency.

In reality, all vibrational states are possible, overlapping, and adapting to their
resonator according to the pitch, yielding a satisfactory or unsatisfactory sense of
homogeneity and level equality. Among the various challenges facing the luthier—
balancing the neck, soundboard, back, sides, and harmonizing these parts—years of
observation are necessary, and the situations remain complex and often contradictory.
Yet, as these insights develop, the experimental builder and creator gain satisfaction.

These satisfactions are limited, as new challenges emerge as control and knowledge advance.

To provide precise insights regarding the back and sides, we conducted and recorded a
series of experiments.

=== Description of Experiments (and Luthier’s Comments)

To this end, we constructed a guitar with a molded plywood back, curved in three layers
(three plies), two rosewood veneers surrounding a core ply of eighteen-tenths of a
millimeter. The total thickness was twenty-eight-tenths of a millimeter, with a maximum
arch height of nineteen millimeters and weighing 272 grams. This back #was not braced#
and constituted experiment number one.

==== Experiment 1

This guitar was easy to play due to the high flexibility of the back. It featured deep,
strong basses due to the low natural frequency of the back as a resonator. However, the
midrange and treble lacked timbre and interest, with limited homogeneity in tone and
sound level. The last three high notes on the first string were weak.

==== Experiment 2

On the same guitar, #the rosette was completely blocked# with a #foam rubber plug#.

The instrument produced only part of its usual sound. The soundboard was constrained by
the air trapped inside, which coupled the back to the soundboard. The sound was very short,
muted, and veiled, with thin basses.

==== Experiment 3

With the rosette open again, #an opening was made in the back identical to the rosette's#
(87 millimeters) at the widest point.

The basses lost their deep timbre, and the sound became flat and generally poor. The
vibrational mode of the back changed due to the opening. Part of the sound dispersed from
the rear (making the instrument less directional), and the sound chamber lost its
resonance role, with the rosette emitting very little, it seems.

==== Experiment 4

#The rosette was closed again, leaving only the back opening#.

The guitar performed better, with the "speaker" emitting bass frequencies from the
cavity more effectively. The treble appeared less affected.

==== Experiment 5

The first back was removed and replaced with a very heavy back (braced with three mahogany
bars), consisting of two glued layers of different woods. The first, rosewood, weighed
280 grams, and the second, mahogany, weighed 155 grams on top, making a total weight of
435 grams without bracing. The playable guitar weighed 1920 grams.

The sound was dry, rigid, rich but lacking warmth, and difficult to play as the neck was
immobilized by the thick, braced back. The neck heel’s direct action, stretching the
slightly curved back, was nullified by the rigidity. As a resonator, it favored higher
frequencies.

==== Experiment 6

The top mahogany layer was planed down over the wide part of the back (<<fig-45,Figure 45>>),
reducing the weight by 90 grams. The guitar now weighed 1830 grams. The sound improved,
gaining warmth, and playability seemed easier. The regular rosewood back, freed from the
extra mahogany thickness on its wider part, favored lower frequencies again, producing a
richer, warmer tone. The balance between bass and treble was satisfactory. This was the
best result of the test series, though the last three notes remained weak.

==== Experiment 7

The remaining mahogany on the narrow part of the back was also planed down
(<<fig-45,Figure 45>>). The guitar now weighed 1,765 grams, with a simple Indian rosewood
back weighing 280 grams (plus its three mahogany braces).

The sound became rounder but thicker and more sluggish, less clear, and less crystalline.
The basses were dark, the first string inconsistent, and the last three notes remained dull.

The back resonated better at low frequencies, and the tone grew darker. The neck had more
freedom to move under string tension, as the back was thinner at the heel.

==== Experiment 8

#The regular rosewood back was carefully removed, and the sides were halved in height#.
The removed back was then refitted, resulting in an ultra-flat guitar of 6 cm thickness.

The sound was somewhat thin overall, clear and biting. The basses were weak, lacking
depth (but the last three high notes on the first string were better), with a dry
listening experience due to the lack of bass.

With the sound chamber volume halved, the instrument lost a major component and its
"body." The natural frequencies of the sides were much higher, reinforcing the extreme
highs.

The back was rather passive at low frequencies, and the neck heel’s effect was minimal
due to its small size (the "lever" action was very limited).

Mr. Leipp, head of the Musical Acoustics Laboratory at Paris VI, reviewed these eight
experiments in the same order and provided commentary on the laboratory analyses during
the second guitar conference, published in the corresponding bulletin, No. 93.

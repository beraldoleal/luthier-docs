= Principles of Classical Guitar Functioning

We distinguish two parts:

1. The Exciter system; these are the strings.
2. The Amplifier and resonator system, consisting of the instrument's soundbox.

The strings provide a rich signal, with many frequencies that will be amplified 
by the soundboard, if it is well-designed, and by the other parts of the 
soundbox.footnote:[Amplified in a practical sense because there is no increase in the energy 
supplied by the strings but an optimization.]

All these parts have their own frequency and behave as resonators.

Since they are attached, glued, they are coupled resonators.

The main challenge is to amplify all the frequencies emitted by the strings 
without favoring or restricting some of them, meaning without over-resonance or 
gaps in the instrument's response, which must be consistent across all notes and 
aim towards this goal.

If the soundboard strongly amplifies a frequency reinforced by the vibration of 
one of the constituent parts, we get over-resonance.

The opposite is also possible.

Thus, we can modify the constituent elements, all the parts to obtain a very 
even response, without harming the qualities already acquired.

Fairly quickly, a new issue arises. The energy communicated by the thumb to the 
string can be restored by the guitar in three seconds or in six seconds, 
depending on its construction.

Then, we will have two extreme possible choices:

1. Build a light guitar, at most 1,600 grams with a thin soundboard, similar to 
   a drum skin. This will give strong amplitudes but fast sound decay, especially 
   if the back is very thin and the sides are the same. This will provide strong 
   basses, a round and generally matte sound, and a short sound where the attacks 
   will be very noticeable.

2. Make a heavier instrument, with thicker dimensions, with a more heavily braced 
   soundboard (well-ribbed) that resists, that acts as a "spring," which is not 
   blocked or at its limit. With a well-thought-out neck, the whole will be in 
   balance with good oscillation potential. Hence: long-lasting sound, maximum 
   power, and excellent efficiency.

It should be noted that nothing can be modified without changing something in 
the response, in the sound of the guitar, for better or for worse. To progress, 
careful observation is necessary.

A technical sheet must be established for each instrument. In the end, the 
builder is solely responsible for choosing his options. He must have a 
synthesizing mind and a certain artistic sense.

There are no "major secrets" for designing and creating a guitar, but there are 
a thousand things to know. There are no "miraculous tricks," only experience and 
a lot of experiments to draw observations, lessons, and solutions from.

Among the many problems faced by the luthier, some present realities that are 
difficult to grasp, partially escaping laboratory techniques, placing them in 
the artistic domain (which remains vast).

These experiments will focus on:

1. Power (from afar, up close)
2. Length of sound
3. Consistency of sound level
4. Timbre
5. Balance between bass and treble
6. Ease or difficulty of touch on the instrument
7. Sound homogeneity
8. Spontaneity of response and sensitivity
9. Sound attack - audible or not
10. Contrast (harpsichord or harp play)
11. Sympathetic resonances - present or not
12. Clarity in chords or muddiness

All these elements constitute the main characteristics of the instrument, but 
in this presentation, we will only cover some of them. #Power and length of 
sound#, in particular. In fact, the experimenter will measure the other elements 
during their research on power and sound length.

What priority should be given to the various parts of the instrument for their 
study?

If we experiment on several points simultaneously, interpretations will be 
uncertain and difficult; thus, by order of importance, we will need to examine:

1. #The soundboard#, with its bracing, wood selection, and thickness.
2. The neck, wood type, thickness.
3. #The body#, the sides, and the back.
4. The bridge with its volume and shape, the arches.
5. The glues, the varnishes.

The study that follows mainly concerns the "Soundboard-Neck-Strings" system. 
Then we will explore the role of the soundboard and the back, complemented by a 
historical and technical approach to bridges.

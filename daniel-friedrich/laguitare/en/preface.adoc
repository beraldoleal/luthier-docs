This work is the original creation of Daniel Friedrich and Emile Leipp, written 
during their participation in the Groupe d'Acoustique Musicale (GAM) at the 
Universit√© Paris VI. The GAM was a pioneering group in the study of musical 
acoustics, and from 1963 to 1987, it played an important role in advancing research 
in this field. Their seminars and publications greatly contributed to the 
dissemination of knowledge on musical instruments, including this in-depth 
exploration of classical guitar construction and acoustics.

As an amateur luthier and long-time admirer of Daniel Friedrich's work, I undertook 
the task of converting this valuable document into a more modern format, suitable 
for reading on devices like tablets and Kindles. My goal was not only to make it 
easier to read, but also to support future translations, thus allowing this 
knowledge to reach a wider audience.
